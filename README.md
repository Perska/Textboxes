# Textboxes
some test with textboxes  
this is incomplete and might not be touched in a long time, probably

- `index.html` A canvas web thing. It has a textbox, and can be made to display things. There's some script commands, too.
- `chat_twitch.html` A very barebones Twitch chat client. Logs in anonymously only, so it's not intended to be used for chatting yourself.
- `chat_sbs.html` A chat client, this time for contentapi (SBS). Requires you to provide an authkey. Does not have chatting support, and it only shows messages by others at this time.
